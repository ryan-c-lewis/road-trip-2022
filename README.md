DAY 1 - Dallas, TX to Albuquerque, NM
------------------------

Headed out around 7 AM. Drive was uneventful, didn't think to take pictures. Got to Albuquerque in the afternoon and checked into a hostel.

DAY 2 - Albuquerque, NM to Monticello, UT
------------------------

Woke up at 3 AM for the Balloon Fiesta, Albuquerque's annual hot air balloon festival. (When I decided to go to Albuquerque, I didn't realize this festival was happening. Happy accident.) Waited in a parking lot with thousands of other people for buses to pick us up. It was surprisingly smooth; they've been doing this for 50 years, so I guess they've got the logistics figured out.

Got to the festival grounds and waited a few hours for stuff to start.

<img src="photos/02_balloonFiesta_sunrise.jpg" width="600" />

If the weather's bad, they'll cancel the events for the day. (But the festival is 9 days, so cancelling 1 day isn't a big deal.) It was looking like they were going to cancel. While we were waiting, I made friends with an older couple. She's a photographer and he's a software architect. 

Eventually the wind settled down and they started inflating the balloons.

<img src="photos/02_balloonFiesta_fire.jpg" width="600" />

Eventually everyone was going up. Hundreds and hundreds, all different types.

<img src="photos/02_balloonFiesta_balloons.jpg" width="600" />

Left the festival and drove up to Utah.

<img src="photos/02_welcomeToUtah.jpg" width="600" />

I booked a campsite in Canyonlands National Park in Utah. By the time I got to the park, a storm started rolling in. It was looking pretty ominous but I kept going.

<img src="photos/02_stormRollingIn.jpg" width="600" />

Eventually it started storming hard and the road flooded. I considered leaving so I wouldn't get stranded. I didn't have cell service so I drove backwards 20 miles until I had service, just so I could check the weather. It looked like it was supposed to clear up in a few hours, so I decided I'd wait by the flooded road until the storm cleared.

I drove back down and the storm kept getting worse. The lightning was intense and I was nervous being in my car. So I drove to a nearby camp bathroom and stayed in there for a few hours. Eventually the storm stopped, but the road was so muddy I couldn't cross (my rental car is 2-wheel drive.) They brought a bulldozer in to clear the road and after a while I was able to cross.

After a 4 hour delay I finally got to the campsite.

DAY 3 - Monticello, UT to Salt Lake City, UT
------------------------

The main reason I picked this campsite was because it was right at the base of some rocks I wanted to climb. So in the morning, I got started in hopes of seeing the sunrise from the top of the rocks.

<img src="photos/03_campsiteAtMorning.jpg" width="600" />

I climbed the first half pretty easily.

<img src="photos/03_overlookingCampsite.jpg" width="600" />

But to get to the top was going to be harder. There was no obvious way up that didn't involve risky climbs. Eventually I picked a route and went. At one point I went out onto a ledge above a steep drop (a fall would have been... very bad.) At first I wasn't worried, but then the ledge stopped and I had no choice but to go straight up onto a smooth section with no good grips. I tried to go backwards the way I came, but I felt like I was losing my balance and about to fall. So I had no choice but to go for it. One of the scariest moments of my life.

<img src="photos/03_exposedClimb.jpg" width="600" />

But I made it and got to the top. I was able to find a safer route down the other side.

<img src="photos/03_sunrise.jpg" width="600" />

Left the campsite and passed back by the bathroom I had stayed in during the storm.

<img src="photos/03_bathroom.jpg" width="600" />

Headed toward Salt Lake City. The drive was beautiful. The desert slowly turned into hills with aspens.

<img src="photos/03_road.jpg" width="600" />

Instead of satying on the interstate, I decided to take a longer scenic route through a national park.

<img src="photos/03_scenicOverlook.jpg" width="600" />

This route passed by a lake with some people fishing.

<img src="photos/03_lake.jpg" width="600" />

Just for kicks decided to get in the water. It was freezing.

<img src="photos/03_gettingInWater.jpg" width="600" />

Got to Salt Lake City and checked into a hostel. Decided to go downtown and see some Mormon things.

<img src="photos/03_cathedral.jpg" width="600" />

(The temple is under construction I guess?)

<img src="photos/03_temple.jpg" width="600" />

Drove to a hill overlooking the city and hiked up it to get a good view. According to a plaque, Brigham Young went up this hill when he was deciding whether to settle on this land.

<img src="photos/03_saltLakeCity_fromHill.jpg" width="600" />

DAY 4 - Salt Lake City, UT to Las Vegas, NV
------------------------

I slept in late, first good night of sleep I've had so far. Originally I was planning to stay in Salt Lake City another day and then go west, but I decided instead to leave today and go south. I was curious to see Las Vegas, and I really wanted to camp in Joshua Tree.

So I headed southwest toward the corner of Utah, Arizona, and Nevada.

<img src="photos/04_welcomeToArizona.jpg" width="600" />

The drive was gorgeous. The grassy mountains of Utah slowly morphed into rock as I got into Arizona.

<img src="photos/04_road.jpg" width="600" />

But as soon as I hit Nevada, it became flat desert.

<img src="photos/04_welcomeToNevada.jpg" width="600" />

Got into Las Vegas and went to see the strip. It was a lot. Didn't really do anything there, just looked around and stayed long enough to get the idea.

<img src="photos/04_lasVegasStrip.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/04_lasVegasFountain.jpg" width="600" />

Ended the night at a dance club in a calmer part of town.

<img src="photos/04_club.jpg" width="600" />

DAY 5 - Las Vegas, NV to Joshua Tree, CA
------------------------

Headed south toward Joshua Tree. Stopped at a small casino on the way out of town. Went in with $20, came out with $40.65!

<img src="photos/05_casino.jpg" width="600" />

Happened to pass by the Hoover Dam, so stopped there to look.

<img src="photos/05_dam.jpg" width="600" />

Kept driving and passed by a cool mountain right next to the highway. So I decided to see if there was a trail to it, and there was!

<img src="photos/05_squadronPeak.jpg" width="600" />

Decided to climb up it, which was hard because it was mostly loose rocks the whole way up. Accidentally found a geocache also!

<img src="photos/05_geocache.jpg" width="600" />

Got close to the top where some climbing was needed, and couldn't find a way past this boulder. It didn't look very stable, so I decided to admit defeat and head back down.

<img src="photos/05_boulder.jpg" width="600" />

But it was a cool view even without getting to the very top:

<img src="photos/05_squadronPeakTop.jpg" width="600" />

Got dinner at a swanky golf club.

<img src="photos/05_resort.jpg" width="600" />

Kept driving toward Joshua Tree.

<img src="photos/05_camper.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/05_sunset.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/05_train.jpg" width="600" />

Didn't get there until night, so it was hard to get good photos.

<img src="photos/05_joshuaTreeSign.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/05_joshuaTreeBrush.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/05_joshuaTreeRock.jpg" width="600" />

DAY 6 - Joshua Tree, CA to Santa Barbara, CA
------------------------

Slept very poorly, so decided to take the day slow and not do much other than drive.

<img src="photos/06_sunrise.jpg" width="600" />

LA traffic was miserable and the gas station coffee was even worse than usual, but the drive was fine. Got to the beach in the early afternoon.

<img src="photos/06_beach.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/06_harbor.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/06_pointCastillo.jpg" width="600" />

Got dinner and headed to the Airbnb early.

DAY 7 - Santa Barbara, CA to Carmel by the Sea, CA
------------------------

Spent the day driving up Highway 1 (which is on the coast) and stopping at anything that looked interesting.

<img src="photos/07_shore1.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/07_birds.jpg" width="600" />

At one point I passed the Big Sur "Jade Festival" which, weirdly enough, is exactly what it sounds like: a festival dedicated to art and jewelry made out of jade stones.

<img src="photos/07_jadeFestival.jpg" width="600" />

Found a cool outcropping that was fun to climb.

<img src="photos/07_peninsula1.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/07_peninsula2.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/07_peninsula3.jpg" width="600" />

The rocks were all loose, so I had a really hard time getting back up to the road after climbing down to see this bridge. I can see why this area is prone to rockslides.

<img src="photos/07_bridge.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/07_clouds.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/07_shore2.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/07_shore3.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/07_shore4.jpg" width="600" />

Eventually made it to Carmel by the Sea where I stayed for the night.

DAY 8 - Carmel by the Sea, CA to Eureka, CA
------------------------

Woke up and drove to Palo Alto to have brunch with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G9gk49VhKM">Karen Wong</a> and her husband George!

<img src="photos/08_wongs.jpg" width="600" />

Drove into San Francisco and wandered around the neighborhoods for a while.

<img src="photos/08_sanFran.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/08_houses.jpg" width="600" />

The streets are crazy here. Total chaos. I was originally planning to stay one more day in this area, but the traffic and crowds were stressing me out so I decided to leave. Wanted to see the Golden Gate first...

<img src="photos/08_goldenGate.jpg" width="600" />

... but the clouds were so low that I really couldn't. Oh well. Hung out for a while at the park right next to the bridge.

<img src="photos/08_park.jpg" width="600" />

The drive north was peaceful after getting out of the city.

<img src="photos/08_roadDay.jpg" width="600" />

Passed a number of vineyards.

<img src="photos/08_vineyard.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/08_vineyard2.jpg" width="600" />

Drove in the dark for a while, could tell that the trees were changing into pines but it was hard to see. Got foggy and spooky for a while.

<img src="photos/08_roadNight.jpg" width="600" />

Ended up at a small town Airbnb for the night.

DAY 9 - Eureka, CA to Bend, OR
------------------------

Decided to try to get all the way to Bend, Oregon today, which would be quite a drive. Got started early so I'd have time to stop at stuff along the way.

<img src="photos/09_sunrise.jpg" width="600" />

Like an area that claimed to have wild elk. I didn't find any.

<img src="photos/09_elkMeadow.jpg" width="600" />

Passed through the Redwood National and State Parks and saw the huge trees. This one is supposedly 1500 years old:

<img src="photos/09_bigTree.jpg" width="600" />

Kept going north into Oregon.

<img src="photos/09_welcomeToOregon.jpg" width="600" />

Stopped at a big cats sanctuary:

<img src="photos/09_jaguars.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/09_lions.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/09_tiger.jpg" width="600" />

Then drove the rest of the way to Bend.

<img src="photos/09_mountain.jpg" width="600" />

<img src="photos/09_river.jpg" width="600" />

The hostel doubles as a bar with live music, and apparently Sunday night is disco night. Might have a tough time getting to sleep...
